# ecommerce

This is an example application for a ecommerce app.
It came to fruition an architecture assignment. The selected architecture was MVVM.

Future plans to this small project:
> Further abstract the views
> Abstract logic for the shopping cart and products list in the DataManagerViewModel
> Create tests
> Create a proper back-end for the aplication
> Create a profile for the user
> Add images to the products
